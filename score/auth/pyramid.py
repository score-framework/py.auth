    An :class:`Authenticator <score.auth.authenticator.Authenticator>` that will
    automatically check if a *username* and *password* were submitted via POST
    and log the user in if the credentials match.

    The class is assuming that the password member is an
    :class:`sqlalchemy_utils.types.password.PasswordType` and will thus compare
    the POSTed *password* directly. It expects a submitted form with the
    following structure to trigger the automatic login on any URL:

    .. code-block:: jinja

        <form method="post">
            <input name="username" />
            <input name="password" type="password" />
